We have three types of data **qualitative**, **quantitative** and **ranked** data. Any statistical analysis is performed on data. The precise form of statistical analysis often depends on the type of data.

## Qualitative Data

A set of observations where any single observavation is a word, letter or numerical code that represents a category.

## Ranked Data

A set of observations where any single observation is a number that indicates relative standing.

## Quantitative Data

A set of observations where a single observation is a number that represents an amount or a count.

Each type of data goes with a level of measurement. A level of measurement specifies the extent to which a number (or word or letter) actually represents some attribute and therefore, has implications for the appropriateness of various arithmetic and statistical procedures.

| Data type    | Level of measurement | Property                  | Examples                      |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Qualitative  | Nominal              | Classification            | Gender (Male, Female)         |
| Ranked       | Ordinal              | Order                     | Mean grade in KCSE (A, A- B+) |
| Quantitative | Interval             | Equal intervals,True zero | Age, height, weight           |

: Data type and levels of measurement

-   Nominal Measurement: Words, letters, or numerical codes of qualitative data that reflect differences in kind based on classification.

-   Ordinal Measurement: Relative standing of ranked data that reflects differences in degree based on order.

-   Interval/Ration Measurement: Amounts or counts of quantitative data reflect differences in degree based on equal intervals and a true zero.
